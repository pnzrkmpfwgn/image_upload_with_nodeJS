# Image Upload and Record to postgres database

This is a simple api written in nodeJS to upload and record images to the postgres database. For now it has very little capabilities but I wanted to keep it simple and basic. For the front-end refer to [https://github.com/pnzrkmpfwgn/imageMania.git](here)
